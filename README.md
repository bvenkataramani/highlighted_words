# highlighted_words
High value item lists for different Neopets shops to use with the highlighter Chrome extension I designed.

## to-do
* Upload the extension files i.e. content.js, etc.
* Fix dual URL problem where highlighter only matches on one of two possible URLs for the shop.
* Fix highlighting bug; only span is getting injected now -- I suspect some CSS injection needs to happen after the matches are made.
